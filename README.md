>>>House Price Prediction


>Overview:
   This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of houses, such as location, size,
number of bedrooms, and more, we can build a model that provides accurate price estimates.
This project is ideal for anyone interested in data science, real estate, or predictive analytics.
